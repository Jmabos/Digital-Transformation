At the heart of every organization is its people.

The **Staff Management Portal** was designed to digitally transform how staff interact with their work‚Äîshifts, timesheets, documents, and disputes‚Äîinto a streamlined experience. I led the **business analysis work** from discovery through to delivery, applying industry-recognized frameworks and agile methodologies.

This case study outlines my journey, key decisions, techniques used, and measurable outcomes delivered.

## üß† Strategy Analysis

### In Scope
A **web-based portal** for staff, HR, and supervisors with:
- Role-based dashboards  
- Rota & timesheet tracking  
- Document library  
- Dispute submission & tracking

### üîç AS-IS Analysis
Manual, error-prone, and fragmented processes:
- Timesheets via paper or Excel  
- Disputes handled verbally/email  
- Payslips manually distributed  
- No central staff hub  

**AS-IS Process Maps**

## Key Takeaways for Business Analysts

- ** Start with people, not tech**: Solve real frustrations, not just build software  
- ** Co-create, don‚Äôt dictate**: Workshops and feedback loops drive adoption  
- ** Trace everything**: A solid traceability matrix avoids scope and test coverage issues  
- ** Demo often**: Biweekly demos helped spot misalignments early
